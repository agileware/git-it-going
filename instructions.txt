# `git init` and then `git status`.
# `rm -rf .git` and then `git status`.

# `git commit -m "Initial commit."`
# `git status`
# Why can't Lewis see my changes?
# `git push origin master`
# View repo in browser.
# Note that this is the most useful part of the talk.


git fetch, merge, pull

# `git fetch`. Note output.
# `git status` and `git log`. Note lack of change.
# `git merge origin/master`.

git revert, reset, checkout

# `git revert HEAD` creates a commit to undo my most recent commit.
